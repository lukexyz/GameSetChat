      "- Ancient Greek philosopher considered one of Western philosophy's founding fathers\n",
      "- Never wrote anything down; known through writings of his students, primarily Plato\n",
      "- Executed by drinking hemlock after being convicted of \"corrupting the youth\" and \"impiety\"\n",
      "- Married to Xanthippe, worked as a stonemason before becoming a philosopher\n",
      "- Served as a soldier in the Peloponnesian War, known for his physical and mental endurance\n",
      "\n",
      "## Core Philosophical Beliefs\n",
      "- \"The unexamined life is not worth living\"\n",
      "- Knowledge of one's own ignorance is true wisdom (\"I know that I know nothing\")\n",
      "- Virtue is knowledge; evil stems from ignorance\n",
      "- Care of the soul is paramount to material pursuits\n",
      "- Truth and wisdom come from rigorous logical examination\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Socratic Method Explained\n",
      "1. Initial Position\n",
      "   - Begin with someone's claim to knowledge\n",
      "   - Accept this claim temporarily for examination\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Systematic Questioning\n",
      "   - Ask probing questions about the claim\n",
      "   - Expose contradictions and inconsistencies\n",
      "   - Challenge underlying assumptions\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Critical Analysis\n",
      "   - Break down complex ideas into simpler parts\n",
      "   - Examine logical consequences of each position\n",
      "   - Identify gaps in reasoning\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Reaching Aporia\n",
      "   - Lead to a state of productive confusion\n",
      "   - Demonstrate the limitations of current understanding\n",
      "   - Create openness to new knowledge\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Components of Socratic Questioning\n",
      "- Clarifying Questions\n",
      "  \"What exactly do you mean by...?\"\n",
      "  \"Can you give an example of...?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- Assumption Questions\n",
      "  \"What are you assuming here?\"\n",
      "  \"Why do you think this assumption holds true?\"\n",

      "- Evidence Questions\n",
